# Research for Master-Blaster

## Description

So this markdown contains the research and data I've pulled out of sites for this project. As I never was a fan of cricket so I really don't know how to judge a cricketer.

> I have no idea about cricket and cricketers.

So this doc serves as a todo board,brainstorming area and factual bulletin.

## Approach

- Collect and show the data about Sachin Tendulkar seperately.
- Compare and contrast it with other cricketers of that and this era.
  - Giving suitable favour to condition of cricket at that point of time.
